# Retail Sales in Canada 2025

## Project Overview
This project visualizes and analyzes retail prices per gram for [product category, e.g., cannabis products, coffee, or other retail goods]. The goal is to identify pricing patterns, detect outliers, and generate actionable insights that can inform pricing strategies, marketing, and inventory decisions.

## Objectives
- Explore pricing trends across different product types, brands, or regions.  
- Identify outliers or unusually high/low prices.  
- Compare prices over time or between categories.  
- Provide insights for potential price optimization and strategic decision-making.  

## Dataset
The dataset contains the following columns:  
- **Product Name** – Identifier for each product.  
- **Price per Gram** – Retail price normalized per gram.
- **Date Recorded**

## Insight & Strategic Implications
Analysis of retail price data from May 2025 published by Statistics Canada indicates that beef rib cuts consistently exhibit the highest per-unit price across the category, highlighting both sustained consumer willingness to pay and potential limited supply. From a marketer's perpective, this insight suggests opportunities to optimize margin contribution through strategic inventory allocation, dynamic pricing, and targeted promotions.

For demand forecasting, beef rib cuts should be modeled as a high-elasticity conusmer product, with careful monitoring of volume-price sensitivity to anticipate substitution effects toward lower-priced cuts. The Price Elasticity of Demand can be easily calcaulted with past historical retail data, given that access to the proprietary data itself is not a barrier.

Additionally, cross-merchandising strategies with complementary products such as side dishes can maximize basket value, while historical pricing trends can inform supplier negotiations and procurement planning. Tracking price volatility alongside consumer segmentation data can further refine assortment strategies, ensuring alignment with premium-focused shopper segments and mitigating potential revenue leakage.
